This code reads and preprocesses a set of four images from a specific directory using the ResNet50 model in Keras. The ResNet50 model is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains over a million images in a thousand different classes.

The read_and_prep_images function reads the images from the specified directory and resizes them to the specified image_size. It then converts the images to arrays and preprocesses them using the preprocess_input function from Keras.

The ResNet50 model is loaded using the ResNet50 function from Keras, and its pre-trained weights are loaded from a specified file. The model is then used to make predictions on the preprocessed images using the predict method.

The decode_predictions function from the decode_predictions module in the learntools.deep_learning package is used to decode the predictions made by the ResNet50 model. It returns the top n predictions for each image in the form of a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the predicted class label, the class name, and the probability of the image belonging to that class.

Finally, the Image function from the IPython.display module is used to display the original images alongside the top three predicted labels for each image.
