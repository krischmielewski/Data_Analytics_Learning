  Define the problem: The first step is to define the problem or question we want to answer. In this case, we may want to understand the relationship between the different variables, identify patterns or trends, and explore any insights that may be useful for dog breeders, veterinarians, or pet owners.

  Collect data: The next step is to collect the data needed to address the problem. We may collect data from various sources, such as dog breed registries, veterinary records, or online surveys. The data set should include information about the 117 dog breeds, their country of origin, fur color, eye color, height, longevity, common health issues, and traits.

  Clean and preprocess data: Once the data has been collected, we need to clean and preprocess it to ensure that it is accurate, complete, and ready for analysis. This may involve removing duplicates, correcting any errors or inconsistencies, and converting data into a consistent format. We may also need to handle missing data or outliers, depending on the data set.

  Analyze data: With the data cleaned and preprocessed, we can now analyze it to identify any patterns, trends, or insights. This may involve using statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, or other data analysis techniques. For example, we may use descriptive statistics to summarize the data, regression analysis to identify relationships between variables, or clustering analysis to group similar dog breeds together.

  Visualize data: Once we have analyzed the data, we can visualize it using charts, graphs, and other visual aids to help communicate the findings and insights to stakeholders. For example, we may create scatter plots to show the relationship between height and longevity, or bar charts to compare the common health issues across different dog breeds.

  Interpret results: The final step is to interpret the results of the analysis and use them to inform business decisions or research. This involves drawing conclusions from the data and identifying actionable insights that can be used to achieve business objectives. For example, we may identify which dog breeds are more prone to specific health issues, or which traits are more desirable for pet owners.
